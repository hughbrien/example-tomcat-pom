This example illustrates how to set up an extremely simple webapp to run
with Tomcat.  This requires Tomcat to be installed (see 
http://www.coreservlets.com/Apache-Tomcat-Tutorial/ for instructions).

Check out the project locally, and run from the top level directory of
the app (make sure it has pom.xml in it if you are not sure!).
If you want to navigate the source through Eclipse, run:
mvn eclipse:eclipse

Run:
mvn package

Change to the target folder and copy the .war file into the web application
directory of your Tomcat installation (C:Program Files/apache-tomcat/webapps/).

Start Tomcat (C:Program Files/apache-tomcat/bin/startup.bat)

The application will start. Navigate to the following URL to see a very
basic servlet:
http://localhost:8080/<insert name of your war file, without extension>/exampleServlet
Ex: http://localhost:8080/example-tomcat-pom-1.0-SNAPSHOT/exampleServlet
